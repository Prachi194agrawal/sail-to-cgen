Type error at file "global_type_var/v2.sail", line 23, character 14 to line 23, character 15

let _ = test([41m64[0m)

Tried performing type coercion from int(64) to int('size) on 64
Coercion failed because:
  int(64) is not a subtype of int('size)
  in context
  * 'size == 'ex14#
  * ('ex14# == 32 | 'ex14# == 64)
  * ('ex13# == 32 | 'ex13# == 64)
  where
  * 'ex13# bound at file "global_type_var/v2.sail", line 5, character 5 to line 5, character 32

let [41m(size as 'size) : {|32, 64|}[0m = 32

  * 'ex14# bound at file "global_type_var/v2.sail", line 5, character 6 to line 5, character 18

let ([41msize as 'size[0m) : {|32, 64|} = 32

  * 'size bound at file "global_type_var/v2.sail", line 5, character 14 to line 5, character 18

let (size as [41m'size[0m) : {|32, 64|} = 32
