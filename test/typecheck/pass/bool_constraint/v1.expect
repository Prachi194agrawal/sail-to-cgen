Type error at file "bool_constraint/v1.sail", line 12, character 20 to line 12, character 20

  if b then n else [41m4[0m

Tried performing type coercion from int(4) to {'m, ('b & 'm == 'n | not('b) & 'm == 3). int('m)} on 4
Coercion failed because:
  int(4) is not a subtype of {('m : Int), (('b & 'm == 'n) | (not('b) & 'm == 3)). int('m)}
  in context
  * 4 == 'ex41#m
  * not('b)
  where
  * 'b bound at file "bool_constraint/v1.sail", line 11, character 1 to line 13, character 1
